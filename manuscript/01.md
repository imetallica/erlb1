# Introduction

## About this book

This book is about writing systems that are naturally distributed, fault-tolerant,
concurrent and time-evolving, how you can take advantage of these features on
embedded systems to make them day-one development ready for Internet of Things.
Also, how to take automatically advantage of multi-core CPUs, which are becoming
common these days, even for embedded systems.

## About the language

Build massively, scalable, real-time systems. This is Erlang's motto without
question. The language, when it was design, at Ericsson's lab it was meant to
run on embedded systems (telecom switches), that should never go down.

Nowadays, with Internet being so popular and cheap, the access through devices
that are always connected to the Internet, make, not only infrastructure a
challenge to maintain, but software a nightmare to build. Software, that needs
to be fast, resilient against failure, able to scale without changing how it
works. A problem telecom companies had years ago we, developers, have today with
the Internet.

On all theses problems, Erlang is quite a good fit for this task. It is a
functional language, that can have thousands of processes running at the same
time. The Erlang virtual machine, the BEAM
